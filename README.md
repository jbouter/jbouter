### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm a consultant at [Warpnet B.V.](https://warpnet.nl) with over eight years of **SRE** and **DevOps** experience.
- ðŸŒ± I'm a Linux geek with a broad interest, varying from [ZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs) to [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher) and [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus).
- :rocket: I love to automate. Whether that is using [SaltStack](https://github.com/saltstack/salt), [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
- :rabbit: I tend to like too many Linux related projects and therefore use many of them. I like both [KDE](https://kde.org/) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/), and [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). I sure hop a lot.
- :guitar: I have a very broad taste in music, and play bass guitar.
