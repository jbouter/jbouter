### Hi there 👋

Note: Even though I have both a [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jbouter) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jbouter) profile, my repositories are on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jbouter)

- 🔭 I'm a consultant at [Warpnet B.V.](https://warpnet.nl) with over ten years of **SRE** and **DevOps** experience.
- ☁️ I work with on-premise cloud solutions such as [Openshift](https://github.com/openshift), [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) and [VMware](https://github.com/vmware), but use [libvirt](https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt) and [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/) as well.
- 📈 I help companies set up their monitoring using [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), and [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager).
- 🌱 I'm a Linux geek with a broad interest, ranging from [ZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs) to [Pipewire](https://github.com/PipeWire).
- 🚀 I love to automate. Whether that is using [SaltStack](https://github.com/saltstack/salt), [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
- 🐸 I use [KDE](https://kde.org/), but it doesn't really matter to me if that's on [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), [OpenSUSE](https://www..opensuse.org/) or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
- 🎸 I have a very broad taste in music, and play bass guitar. I play around with [Harrison Mixbus](https://harrisonconsoles.com/product/mixbus/) a lot in my friend's music studio.
